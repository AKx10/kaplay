# 0.2.0
- added `level.spawn()`
- added area component generation for `text()`
- added `noArea` to conf field of `sprite()`, `rect()` and `text()`, allowing to disable auto area component generation
- added a `quad` field to sprite comp creation config `sprite(id, { quad: quad(0, 0, 0.5, 0.5) })`
- fixed `resolve()` not working if the obj also has `solid`, so it does not check for itself
- `mousePos()` accepts a layer argument, which returns the mouse position affected by camera transform if that layer is not `camIgnore()`-ed

# 0.1.0
- (**BREAK**) changed default origin point to `"topleft"`, so if you want object origin point to be at center you'll need to manual `origin("center")`
- (**BREAK**) integrated `kit/physics` and `kit/level` to main lib
- (**BREAK**) makes `collides()` only run on first collision, not run every frame during the same collision
- (**BREAK**) `camPos()` by default focuses to center, so `camPos(player.pos)` puts player in the center of the screen
- (**BREAK**) renamed `kaboom.import()` to `kaboom.global()`
- added an arg field to `start(scene, ...)` to forward args to start scene
- added `camScale()`, `camRot()` and `camIgnore()`
- added `obj.overlaps()` by `area()`, and `overlaps()`
- added 3 ext fonts under `ext/fonts`
