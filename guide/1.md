First load our assets with

```js
loadSprite("guy", "guy.png");
loadSound("shoot", "shoot.ogg");
```

Start describing a scene with

```js
scene("main");
```

from now on, the code below will be describing the scene `"main"`, until another `scene()`, or `start()`.

we can start defining what objects should be added to the scene when the scene loads:

```js
scene("main");

const player = sprite("guy", {
	pos: vec2(0),
});
```

this will add a sprite loaded as `"guy"`, on position `vec2(0, 0)`

let's call `start("main")` at the end to actually run the game, and see what we got on screen

```js
scene("main");

const player = sprite("guy", {
	pos: vec2(0),
});

start("main");
```

we can see our `"guy.png"` is being drawn on the center of the screen

we can use this to listen to user input, and move the player when user presses left

```js
keyDown("left", () => {
	player.pos.x -= 120 * dt();
});
```
