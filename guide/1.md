Let's make a top-down shooter game!

First load our assets with

```js
// load resources into the asset manager, using the first argument as the name / key
loadSprite("guy", "guy.png");
loadSound("shoot", "shoot.ogg");
```

[lib] uses a scene description system, which looks like this on a high level:

```js
// start describing "main" scene
scene("main");

sprite("froggy", {
	pos: vec2(120),
});

// start describing "menu" scene
scene("menu");

// start describing "gameover" scene
scene("gameover");

text("You Win!");
play("winSound");

// scene description complete, start the game now with "menu" scene
start("menu");
```

but let's not worry about multiple scenes for now, let's make the game scene first!

first let's add a sprite to the scene, representing the player:

```js
scene("main");

const player = sprite("guy", {
	pos: vec2(0),
});

start("main");
```

we can see our `"guy.png"` is being drawn on the center of the screen

we can use this to listen to user input, and move the player when user presses left

```js
keyDown("left", () => {
	player.pos.x -= 120 * dt();
});
```
